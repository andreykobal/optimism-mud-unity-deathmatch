## LeaderboardCounterSystem smart contract

The LeaderboardCounterSystem smart contract is a key component of the Optimism Deathmatch project, designed to manage player statistics and global leaderboards. This smart contract ensures a fair and transparent gaming experience for all participants.

Features
1. üéÆ Incrementing Kills: The incrementKills function allows players to increment their kill count. Every successful kill increases the player's kill count by 1, contributing to their overall performance in the game.

2. üî´ Incrementing Deaths: The incrementDeaths function enables players to increment their death count. Each time a player is eliminated, their death count increases by 1, providing insights into their resilience and gameplay strategies.

3. üèÜ Incrementing Score: The incrementScore function introduces a scoring mechanism where players can earn points based on their in-game achievements. By specifying a value, multiplied by 100, players can increment their score and climb up the leaderboard. The score is a reflection of their overall performance and success in the game.

4. üìä Player Statistics: The smart contract stores and manages player statistics through the Player struct. This includes the player's name, kill count, death count, and score. Players can retrieve their own statistics using the getPlayerStats function, providing them with an overview of their performance and progress.

5. üåç Global Leaderboard: The getGlobalLeaderboard function allows players to access the global leaderboard. By querying this function, players can obtain an array of addresses representing the top players and their corresponding scores. This fosters healthy competition and motivates players to strive for excellence.

### Usage
To integrate the LeaderboardCounterSystem smart contract into your MUD game, follow these steps:

* Deploy the smart contract to the Optimism network using the provided deployment instructions.

* In your MUD game, import the smart contract ABI and create an instance of the contract using the deployed contract address.

* Call the various functions provided by the smart contract to manage player statistics. Use incrementKills to increase a player's kill count, incrementDeaths to update the death count, and incrementScore to adjust the player's score based on in-game achievements.

* Retrieve player statistics using the getPlayerStats function to display personalized performance information to players.

* Utilize the getGlobalLeaderboard function to showcase the top players and their scores in your game's leaderboard.

## Documentation :book:

## Community and Support :bulb:

For any questions, suggestions, or support, please reach out to our team at [email protected]

Let the battle begin! Step into the future of gaming with Optimism Deathmatch. :crossed_swords:

## Prerequisites

1. git ([download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
2. foundry (forge, anvil, cast) ([download](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), make sure to foundryup at least once)
3. node.js (v16+) ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
4. pnpm (after installing node: npm install --global pnpm)
5. Unity ([download](https://unity.com/download))
6. The .NET SDK (7.0) ([download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download))

If you are using Windows:

1. install git bash (gitforwindows.org)
2. install nodejs, including ‚Äúnative modules‚Äù (nodejs.org/en/download) (re native modules: just keep the checkmark, it‚Äôs enabled by default in the installer)
3. Install foundry via foundryup using Git bash

## Tutorial

The tutorial repo for this template can be found [here](https://github.com/emergenceland/tankmud-tutorial).

## Quickstart

Run the following command in the root:

```
pnpm install
```

Then, open two terminal tabs.

In tab 1:

```
pnpm run dev:node
```

In tab 2:

```
pnpm run dev
```

In Unity, Open the Main scene if you haven‚Äôt already `(packages/client/Assets/Scenes/Main.unity)`.
Press play. Click to increment the counter.

## Usage

MUD Template Unity autogenerates C# definitions for your Tables when you run `pnpm dev`. These should appear in `packages/client/Assets/Scripts/codegen/`.

### Getting a value

```csharp
var addressKey = net.addressKey;
// get by key
var currentPlayer = PlayerTable.GetTableValue(addressKey);

// currentPlayer is strongly typed
string name = currentPlayer.name;
```

### Subscribing to updates

```csharp
var playerSubInsert = PlayerTable.OnRecordInsert().ObserveOnMainThread().Subscribe(OnInsertPlayers);

var playerSubUpdate = PlayerTable.OnRecordUpdate().ObserveOnMainThread().Subscribe(OnDeletePlayers);

var playerSubDelete = PlayerTable.OnRecordDelete().ObserveOnMainThread().Subscribe(OnDeletePlayers);

var playerSubDeleteInsert = PlayerTable.OnRecordInsert.Merge(PlayerTable.OnRecordDelete).ObserveOnMainThread().Subscribe(OnInsertDeletePlayers);


private void OnUpdatePlayers(PlayerTableUpdate update)
{
	// PlayerTableUpdate has a TypedValue, which is a Tuple of <PlayerTable,PlayerTable>
	// Item 1 is the current value, and Item 2 is the previous value.
	var currentValue = update.TypedValue.Item1;
	if (currentValue == null) return;
	var previousValue = update.TypedValue.Item2;

 // PlayerTableUpdate inherits from UniMUD's RecordUpdate
 // So you can still get the key, table, and untyped values.
	var playerPosition = PositionTable.GetTableValue(update.Key);
	if (playerPosition == null) return;

	var playerSpawnPoint = new Vector3((float)playerPosition.x, 0, (float)playerPosition.y);
	var player = Instantiate(playerPrefab, playerSpawnPoint, Quaternion.identity);

	if (update.Key == net.addressKey) {
		Debug.Log("Is local player");
	}
}
```

### Making a transaction

This template generates Nethereum bindings for your World contract, which, we can access to make a transaction.
Note that not all Unity functions can be async, so you may need to wrap your transaction in a coroutine.

```csharp
	async void Spawn(NetworkManager nm)
	{
		var addressKey = net.addressKey;
		var currentPlayer = PlayerTable.GetTableValue(addressKey);
		if (currentPlayer == null)
		{
			// spawn the player
			await nm.worldSend.TxExecute<SpawnFunction>(0, 0);
		}
	}

	// For example, with the UniTask library:
	private async UniTaskVoid SendIncrementTxAsync()
	{
		try
		{
			await net.worldSend.TxExecute<IncrementFunction>();
		}
		catch (Exception ex)
		{
			// Handle your exception here
			Debug.LogException(ex);
		}
	}
```



### Deploying to a Testnet

You can deploy to any non-local chain with `cd packages/contracts && pnpm run deploy:testnet`.
Be sure to properly set the ChainID and RPC urls in the **NetworkManager** component.

UniMUD currently doesn‚Äôt implement the faucet service, so you must manually send testnet funds to your address. Your address is logged in Debug mode, but you can also create a UI component to fetch and display it from the NetworkManager.



## Deploying to Optimism

To deploy your Optimism Deathmatch project to the Optimism network, follow these steps:

### Setup Optimism Environment:

* pnpm (after installing Node.js: npm install --global pnpm)
* Unity (download: https://unity.com)
* The .NET SDK (7.0) (download: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* If you're using Windows:

* Install git bash (https://gitforwindows.org)
* Install Node.js, including "native modules" (keep the checkmark enabled during installation, as it's enabled by default)
* Clone the Project:

Clone the Optimism Deathmatch project repository using git:

```git clone https://github.com/andreykobal/optimism-mud-unity-deathmatch```
Install Dependencies:

###Configure Optimism Network:

In the packages/contracts directory, create a .env file with the following content:
rust
Copy code
ETH_NETWORK='localOptimism'
LATTICE_SERVER='http://localhost:8000'

### Deploy Contracts to Optimism:

Deploy the contracts to the Optimism network by running the following command:

```pnpm run deploy:optimism```
Start the Optimism Environment:

Start the Optimism environment using Foundry:

```foundry up```
